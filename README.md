# polyp-Seg

## Dataset Details
The self-built dataset comprises 1470 high-quality NBI colonoscopy images with corresponding pixel-level segmentation annotations. It consists of two components: 1,000 NBI images publicly released by the 7th International Symposium on Image Computing and Digital Medicine (ISICDM 2024) (conference website:https://www.imagecomputing.org/isicdm2024), and 470 NBI images collected from clinical colonoscopy procedures at Xiangyang Central Hospital. The self-collected images were retrospectively screened by a junior endoscopist from colonoscopy cases conducted between January 1, 2023, and March 10, 2024. The inclusion criteria require patients to have polyps observed under NBI mode along with corresponding pathological diagnostic reports, where serves as the gold standard for determining the presence and type of polyps. A total of 470 images from 72 patients were collected, and each image was pixel-level annotated by experienced endoscopists to produce high-quality segmentation masks. The data collected from Xiangyang Central Hospital strictly adhere to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and approval is obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Xiangyang Central Hospital (No. 2024–145). Written informed consent is waived due to the retrospective nature of the study, as permitted by the committees.
